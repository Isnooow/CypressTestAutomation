# Welcome to My StudyCase Cypress

Hi! I'm Isno Wahno Putro. This is the result of a cypress automation testing script that I made for a job search website.

## Objective

From the automation scipt made I have 2 test objectives, namely:
1. Functional Test
Tests that aim to **ensure that each feature or function of the application works as expected**, based on the needs. functional tests that I do are:
	- Login Test
	- Register Test
	- Search Mentor Test
	- Request a Session Mentor Test
2. User Interface Test
testing that focuses on **ensuring that the elements of the user interface (UI) function and appear correctly**.User Interface Test that I do is :
	- Header
	- Body
	- Footer
